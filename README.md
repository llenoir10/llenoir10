<h1>Welcome!<h1>

Follow me on my journey from administration to cloud engineeting. After years of solving real-world problems for people, I’m now focused on solving them with code—automating infrastructure, building scalable systems, and leveraging the cloud to drive innovation.

I'm currently sharpening my skills in:

☁️ Cloud platforms like Azure (certification in progress)

🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)

🐍 Python scripting

🐳 Containers (Docker, Kubernetes)

🔧 DevOps tools & CI/CD pipelines

My background in customer service gives me a unique edge: I understand end-user needs, communicate clearly with teams, and stay calm under pressure. Now I’m bringing those strengths into tech.

I'm actively working on hands-on projects, labs, and certifications to build a solid foundation in cloud and DevOps. Check out my repositories to follow my journey!
