<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Hi, I'm Latrice

Follow me on my journey from administration/customer service to cloud engineering. After years of solving real-world problems for people, I’m now focused on solving them with code—automating infrastructure, building scalable systems, and leveraging the cloud to drive innovation.

I'm actively working on hands-on projects, labs, and certifications to build a solid foundation in cloud and DevOps. Check out my repositories to follow my journey!
